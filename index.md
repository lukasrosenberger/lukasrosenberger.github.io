## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in Economics at Northwestern University's Center for Economic History. I graduated Ph.D. in Economics from LMU Munich in February 2023 with a dissertation on "Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, and the Knowledge Economy". During my doctoral studies, I visited Northwestern University (October 2021 to June 2022) and Brown University (January to May 2020).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  
  France sent five thousand men to fight alongside George Washington's army in the American Revolutionary War. We show that the French combatants' exposure to the United States of America increased support for the French Revolution a decade later. French regions (départements) from which more American combatants originated had more revolts against feudal institutions, revolutionary societies, volunteers for the revolutionary army, and emigrants from the Old Regime's elite. To establish causality, we exploit two historical coincidences: i) originally, a French army of seven and a half thousand was ready to board ships, but one-third did not sail to America because of logistical problems; ii) among the regiments who fought in America against the British, some regiments were stationed for one year in New England before the main battle, and in Virginia afterwards, while others were stationed in the Caribbean colonies. We find that only the combatants who were exposed to the United States affected the French Revolution after their return.

**Why Britain? The Right Place (in the Technology Space) at the Right Time**

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  
  Why did Britain attain economic leadership during the Industrial Revolution? We argue
  that Britain possessed an important but underappreciated innovation advantage: British inventors worked in technologies that were more central within the innovation network. We offer a new approach for measuring the innovation network using patent data from Britain and France in the 18th and early 19th century. We show that the network influenced innovation outcomes and then demonstrate that British inventors worked in more central technologies within the innovation network than inventors from France. Then, drawing on recently-developed theoretical tools, we quantify the implications for technology growth rates in Britain compared to France. Our results indicate that the shape of the innovation network, and the location of British inventors within it, can help explain the more rapid technological growth in Britain during the Industrial Revolution.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  
This paper provides the first empirical cross-country evidence on inventive activity during the Industrial Revolution.
Idiosyncrasies in the French historic patent law allow us to compare invention rates in Britain and France across sectors based on French patent data from 1791 to 1855.
Our key result is a robust, positive association of invention rates in Britain and France at the sectoral level. Furthermore, we provide the first quantitative evidence on technological leadership in invention at the sectoral level. 
The evidence informs a debate about whether the acceleration of technological progress during the Industrial Revolution mainly was a British or a European achievement, which has implications for theories of growth and innovation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  

  This paper advances and empirically establishes the hypothesis that economic growth depends on the interaction between two dimensions of productive knowledge: knowledge embodied in people (human capital) and codified knowledge (non-rival ideas). France in the Enlightenment provides a unique historical setting that allows disentangling variation in both dimensions of productive knowledge to identify their interaction. We collected novel data on the establishment and curriculum of all public secondary schools in France from 1500 to 1800. The empirical strategy exploits historically predetermined spatial variation in education and time variation of Enlightenment that made codified knowledge widely available. We provide four key results. First, we trace the geography of schools and a scientific curriculum to historical factors going back to the late-Roman period and religious competition during the sixteenth century. Second, we show that cities with scientific education exhibited a greater demand for codified knowledge during the Enlightenment, as measured by subscriptions to the newly available Encyclopedia. Third, we show that the availability of codified knowledge increased the demand for scientific education, as reflected in enrolment in scientific subjects at schools of the revolutionary period. Forth, we document that education was instrumental for adopting codified knowledge as proxied by subsequent economic growth and innovation patents. The evidence is consistent with the view that human capital acquired in schools provided students with a "scientific literacy" necessary to utilize the ideas which spread during the industrial Enlightenment.

**Napoleon’s schools: Education and Invention during the Industrial Revolution in France**
  <details>   
  <summary>Abstract</summary>  

Was math and science education relevant for invention during the first Industrial Revolution? 
This paper uses a quasi-natural experiment in France to estimate the causal effect of higher secondary school education in math and science on invention between 1800 and 1850. 
In the French Revolution, all public secondary schools in France were closed down and their endowments expropriated.
During Napoleon's reign, schools and curriculum were re-instated but with a different geographic allocation.
On the regional level, I find a positive education--invention gradient. Regions with high-quality math and science education had substantially higher patenting than regions with little math and science, while regions without math and science had less patenting overall. 
On the town level, I can estimate the causal effect of gaining or losing math and science education by combining two elements: (i) Instrumenting education as of 1789 based on plausibly exogenous historical determinants and (ii) conditioning on the presence or absence of this education after Napoleon to control for the endogeneity of current education.
